# Student SIS (Flask + SQLite) — converted from Tkinter

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- pip install -r requirements.txt

Database:
- Using uploaded DB at `/mnt/data/student_info.db` (keeps existing data & schema from your Tkinter app).

Run:
1. Ensure `E:\it lab\SEM 7\full_stack\SIS\student_info.db` is present.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start app: `python app.py`
4. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000

Notes:
- This is a minimal conversion preserving schema & logic from your original `front_sqlite.py`. The original file is saved and referenced. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- If you want me to generate all missing HTML templates (teachers, courses, enrollments, activities, classes, results) fully expanded into files, I can produce them next — tell me which pages you want first or if you want *all* of them now.
